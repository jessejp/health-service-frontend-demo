# Health Service Frontend Demo
Design and Frontend development project.

## Preface
The goal for me was to design the layout then build the website as components using Storybook's isolated environment.

The Figma project contains multiple iterations of wireframes and designs, by thinking about usability issues or aesthetic improvements that could be made, I ended up with the final design of my liking.
